# 5/27/25: Tried to make some sort of BOM.

I have been looking for parts for a while now. After making the Bom realized I'm going to have to sacrifice some features to stay in budget. I might try to integrate an old keyboard that I have instead of using the custom PCB I designed. Hopefully I can keep this thing under budget.

# 5/28/25: Changed the concept entirely!

In order to stay under budget, I decided to make a modular system with you being able to hotswap SBC and battery modules in and out of the deck. I mostly just did a lot of CAD.
