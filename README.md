# Assembly Instructions
- ## Exoskeleton
  - ### Printing
1. Print Both main case peices vertically
2. Print both rear cases flat or vertically if you have elephants foot issues
3. Assemble both sides of each part together using either superglue, plastic welding, or your preferred method of attaching 3d prints. 
  - ### Wiring
1. Press fit all of the connectors including, HDMI, XT60, and the magnetic 4pin adafruit connector.

1. Print the pi 5 compute model.
2. Solder 28awg wire to the 4 USB pins from the Bottom of the USB 2.0 connector on the set of pins closest to the edge of the board.
3. Remove the casing from the micro HDMI to HDMI adapter.
4. Press the HDMI into the casing.
5. Solder the 5v and gnd connections from the gpio to the + and - terminals onto an xt60 connector using 18awg wire. Press the connector into the 5v part of the module.
